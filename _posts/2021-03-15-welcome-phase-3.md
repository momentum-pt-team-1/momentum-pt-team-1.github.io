⚠️ And even for experienced engineers, their experience is limited to certain areas, and completely dependent on having had opportunities to develop that experience. What you don't know will always outweigh what you do as long as you work in a field that moves as fast as tech does.

If that seems discouraging, see this great blog post by one of the most well-respected and influential developers out there right now.

## 📝 TODO for everyone

- [Learn markdown](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/markdown/)
- Pick a note-taking application that will let you take notes while you read and work. It's important that it can properly format code blocks. Here are some options (but don't spend more than 10 minutes making this choice).
  - [VS Code](https://helgeklein.com/blog/2020/10/vs-code-as-markdown-note-taking-app/) (with this option you could create a simple git repo with markdown files)
  - [BoostNote](https://boostnote.io/)
  - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
  - [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
